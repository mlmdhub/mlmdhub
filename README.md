The project utilizing residual networks for particle jet feature extraction at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) aims to leverage deep learning technology to address crucial issues in particle physics research. 
The LHC stands as the world's largest and most energetic particle accelerator, generating copious particle jets in its collision events, constituting vital signals in particle physics investigations. 
Conventional approaches to particle jet analysis often rely on manually crafted feature extractors and classifiers, where feature selection and design hinge heavily on the expertise and knowledge of domain specialists. 
Nevertheless, due to the complexity and diversity of particle jets, manually engineered feature extractors frequently fall short in comprehensively capturing the crucial aspects of jets, thereby constraining classification performance. 
To surmount these challenges, researchers are delving into the realm of deep learning methodologies. 
Resnet (Residual Network), as a potent deep learning model, is being introduced into the study of particle jet feature extraction at the LHC, aiding in jet identification and labeling tasks. 
By incorporating residual connections, Resnet tackles the issues of vanishing and exploding gradients during the training of deep neural networks. 
This connection approach enables the network to retain original feature information throughout the learning process, harmonizing it with learned high-level features. 
Consequently, the residual network excels in capturing subtle variations and crucial features within particle jets, thereby augmenting the recognition and classification capabilities concerning particle jets.
